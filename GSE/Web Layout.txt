	Node.js serving website: SUBs to telemServer, REQ with serialServer
		- responsible for receiving data from telemServer, storing it in graph form
		- also for Requesting to serialServer (commander.py stuff), receiving response from commander.py

	Python telemServer: SUBs to serialServer, PUBs to Website
		- receives python objects for processing
		- replaceable telem processor; does calculations, other stuff, depending on project
		- no visuals involved

	Python serialServer: PUBs to telemServer, REP from Website
		- takes in data at baud rate and sends it as python objects to telemServer
		- also may receive Requests from website directly; send to serial, and reply as needed
